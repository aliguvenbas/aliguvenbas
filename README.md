### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been a software professional more than ten years. Currently, I am working in an educational IT solution supplier 
company in the Netherlands as a senior backend developer and scrum master. 
I also take responsibility for team and product management within the company. 
Creating new things and sharing with people are my main motivational factors.
